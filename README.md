# Coding in C

This repository contains various programming tasks and projects written in **C**. It is a collection of assignments and practice exercises that focus on fundamental concepts of the C programming language, such as control flow, arrays, functions, pointers, memory management, strings, and structures.

## Topics Covered

The repository is organized based on the topics we've learned in the C language, as follows:

1. **Control Flow**:
   - If, else, switch
   - Loops (for, while, do-while)
   - Break and continue

2. **1D Arrays**:
   - Array initialization
   - Array manipulation

3. **2D Arrays**:
   - Multi-dimensional arrays
   - Matrix operations

4. **Functions**:
   - Defining functions
   - Function parameters and return types
   - Recursive functions

5. **Dynamic Memory Allocation and Pointers**:
   - Using pointers for dynamic memory allocation
   - Functions with pointers
   - Pointer arithmetic
   - Using malloc, free
   - Handling dynamic arrays

6. **Strings**:
   - String manipulation
   - Functions for string handling

7. **Structures and Files**:
   - Defining structures
   - File I/O (reading and writing files)
